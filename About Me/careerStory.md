## My reflection 
There are several reasons which lead me to the current status.
* Have a variety of interests and become a Jack of all trade
* Too shy and embarrassed to ask for help
* Too high self-expectation to not consider other choices
* Worry too much and miss opportunities

But I also have/am 
* Really broad breadth of knowledge
* A strong heart which can keep calm under stress
* Super resilient as I get up after falling many times
* Crazy curiosity like a child
