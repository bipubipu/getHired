## What's your achivement today?
Found a way to search for information.    
Made my own OKR plan following [Sofia's OKR goal](https://github.com/sophi-li/OKRs-self-learning). Surprised to see this journal template is very similar to her OKR reflection.     
Learned about untraditional ways to get a job. (Need to be creative!!!)   
Healed a friend.   

## What are you grateful of?
I finally understand why I am important to my friend. I'm lucky to have the gift of high empathy.

## What you wish you can do better?
I spent a lot of time making plans! I really hope that I can stick to them!
