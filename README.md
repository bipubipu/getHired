## What is it?
getHired basically have these following functions:
* journal your findings, thoughts in job hunting
* Q&A section

If you a job seeker, you can use this as a template to 
In different people's eyes, it may not be the same. For me, it means getting a job in 3 months and exploring possible repeatable paths to employment. It can also be
seen as a large-scale open source project or an experiment on career coaches' claimed 'getting hired in 3 months' theories.

## Why do you want to do this?
One of common practices is stating you're open to work and having connections share your posts on LinkedIn. But there are several weaknesses:
- No time frame
- No tracking of progress
- No colloboration
This pushes me to think of a more interactive way to ask for help, to share knowledge or experience. Then I think GitHub is a good place to be. 

GitHub is:
* suitable for multiple people colloboration
* free, public to everyone
* good at version control

## Why do you set a 3 month restriction?
A time frame is good for both you(supporter) and me. If you care about the result but don't want to know details, check this repo 3 months later. Another reason is 
that my current saving can only support me for another 3 months. If I can't achieve the goal, I'll leave. 

## How does it work?
It utilises the theory of six degrees of separation. The more people participated, the better result it would be.

## Worst case senario
No one cares. Then I'll leave without regret.
