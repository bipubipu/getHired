## What's your achivement today?
Completed study of Event part (bubbling, capturing, delegation, dispatch).
Made a draft of my next blog!

## What are you grateful of?
A lovely friend who provided me insider views as being a developer, like how to communicate with others, what skills to learn, what's trendy. I feel so grateful to have such a friend.  

## What you wish you can do better?
I should build projects earlier and learn knowledge while doing them.
