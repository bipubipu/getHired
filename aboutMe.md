Don't be confused by the name of bipubipu which has no specific meaning. I'm more well-recognised as geek lady!  

## Career goal
I'm training myself to be a software developerüíª  
My interests start from preparing for C language programming exam. I was very bad at it in the beginning but after a month of daily training, I got addicted.
As my major in uni is not computer science or software development, and at that time, few girls chose this as a career. <strong>See it and you can be it.</strong> I didn't pursue it after graduation. By the way, I studied Atmospheric Science (branch of Earth Science) where we were required to program in FORTRAN or MATLAB.

Then time comes to 2020, a year that changed many people's lives, like me.

Apart from personal interests, here are other factors which make me set up my mind:  
* IT industry is the least impacted industry by the pandemic. In other words, it's more resilient.
* Developer is the occupation which cares least about education and work experience. It can be translated as 'super friendly for career changers'.
* So many successful stories of career changers. Very clear path for beginners.
* Coding skills can be picked up easier than communication (which needs at least two people!)
* I might have gift in it? My instrinct.

‚ùì What?? I remember you were super into cybersecurity.  
‚úîÔ∏è I'm still are. Cybersecurity is like flowing in my blood perhaps I just like mystery, puzzle solving. But in reality, it is not an entry level job for people almost without experience like me. Plus, I'm not a citizen. T_T

‚ùì Why don't you pursue BA? I hear that's a really cool job!  
‚úîÔ∏è I want to but I find it hard for me to show my ability. I say that I'm an ecommerce expert, would you believe? Nah, this job's related skill can only be shown through talking. Just too hard for me prove.  

## Work rights
Full working rights in Australia. 

## My reflection 
There are several reasons which lead me to the current status.
* Have a variety of interests and become a Jack of all trade
* Too shy and embarrassed to ask for help
* Too high self-expectation to not consider other choices
* Worry too much and miss opportunities

But I also have/am 
* Really broad breadth of knowledge
* A strong heart which can keep calm under stress
* Super resilient as I get up after falling many times
* Crazy curiosity like a child
