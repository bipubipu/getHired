## What is it?
getHired basically have these following functions:
* show career goal, career stories 
* Q&A where you can ask questions in Issues section
* curation of resume, interview, networking tips, etc.
* journal your findings, thoughts in job hunting
* showcase your projects
* more waiting for you to create!

If you a job seeker, you can use this as a template in your job hunting. For others, this is a chance to contribute to open source project and learn from others.


## Why do you want to do this?
One of common practices in looking for work is to state you're open to work and have connections share your posts on LinkedIn. But there are several weaknesses:
- No time frame
- No tracking of progress
- No colloboration  

This pushes me to think of a more interactive way to ask for help, to share knowledge or experience. Then I think GitHub is a good place to be. 

GitHub is:
* suitable for multiple people colloboration
* free, public to everyone
* good at version control

## Why do you set a 3 month restriction?
A timeframe is good for both you(supporter) and me. If you care about the result but don't want to know details, check this repo 3 months later. Another reason is 
that my current saving can only support me for another 3 months. If I can't achieve the goal, I'll leave this country. 

## Why do you just start?
I I I don't have much to show before o(TÔπèT)o

## How does it work?
It utilises the theory of six degrees of separation. The more people participated, the better result it would be.

## Worst case senario
No one cares. Then I'll leave without regret.

## Any rules here?
Be a human.
