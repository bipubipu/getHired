## What's your achivement today?
There are so many things to brag about, haha, kidding.
Built and designed my first personal website, integrated many functions. 

## What are you grateful of?
Friends.
The website wouldn't be possible without them.

## What you wish you can do better?
There's one saying called premature optimisation is the root of all evil. It's very true in my case. I spent excessive time in details. 
The right way should be 'let the car run first, and then run faster.'

Still, ask help. There are many people willing to help but I only wait for those who come to me first. It's really bad.

How to do carousel.

Helped others in major selection  
Did a run again  
Registered a domain  

## What are you grateful of?
There are many people I even don't know support me. This is beyond my expectation. And there are old friends/acquaintances gave me good advice.   
It's beyond my expectation.  

## What you wish you can do better?
I would start work on projects in the beginning.

# Day 1
## What have you learned today?
天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为。——《孟子》  
Struggles in life make people stronger.

Imposter Syndrome again.  
Apply for roles which you can fit 60%. A lot more than I applied before.

How to toggle a menu? == Click to shown hidden text, another click to hide text again.   
A smart way is to use classList.toggle() method!

## What are you grateful of?
My parents are supporting me unconditionally.  
Nice, kind people who show support on LinkedIn.  

## What you wish you can do better?
Go to bed earlier and get up immediately after alarm rang. No more sleep in.
