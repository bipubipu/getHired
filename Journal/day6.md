## What's your achivement today?
Mocked an online coding interview.
I thought I couldn't explain the solution but I actually can.
And my first submission is faster than 85% of other submissions.


## What are you grateful of?
More friends share their stories with me, like how to succeed in interviews, how to build reputation and find gigs.
Feeling being loved and supported.

## What you wish you can do better?
Have an open mind. Don't say no to other opportunities too soon.
